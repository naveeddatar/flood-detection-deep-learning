# ðŸŒŠ Flood Detection with Deep Learning (Fastai + Gradio)

This project uses Fastai and a pretrained ResNet50 model to detect flood-affected areas from satellite images. It features a user-friendly Gradio web interface to allow real-time image classification, aimed at supporting disaster response and job-readiness in AI/ML.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Flooded vs. Non-Flooded image classification
- Transfer learning using ResNet50
- Built using Fastai (on top of PyTorch)
- Gradio app for real-time predictions
- Ready for deployment and portfolio presentation

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- Fastai
- PyTorch
- Gradio
- Jupyter Notebook
